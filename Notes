    6.2 then add the content and plugins into tailwind css

7. We used Line clamp library of TAILWIND css in title to make it only for 2 lines if greater than 2 lines then it will be denoted as "..." only for the "POSTCARD".

NOTES: 
1. whitespace nowrap : will prevent wrapping that is no next line
2. text-sm : text size to small
3. sm:text-xl : this means if the size if >mobile size then the font will be xl
4. dark:text-white : this means when we use white mode then text color will be white
5. pill: makes the button or anything border radius more circular that is increases radius
6. w:width && h: height
